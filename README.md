# Ebay Amazon DPD data analyzer

## Overview

This project consists of 3 notebooks that perform specific tasks related to eBay sale, Amazon reports and DPD tracking status retrieval. The notebooks utilize Python to scrape data as well as interact with the necessary APIs and process the retrieved data.


## Notebook 1: eBay Sale Analysis

In this project, I conducted an analysis of online sales data with the objective of gaining insights and creating visually appealing visualizations. The dataset used for this analysis comprised a collection of online sales transactions from ebay. The primary goal of the project was to explore the patterns, trends, and characteristics within the online sales data. By applying various data analysis techniques, I aimed to uncover valuable information that could be used for decision-making and business strategies.

To begin the analysis, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to ensure the accuracy and quality of the dataset. This involved handling missing values, addressing inconsistencies, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis. One of the highlights of the project was the creation of captivating visualizations. Leveraging powerful data visualization libraries such as `Matplotlib`,`Seaborn`, and I developed a range of visually appealing charts and graphs. 

Overall, this project not only involved analyzing online sales data but also focused on transforming the findings into visualizations. By effectively communicating the insights derived from the data, these visualizations contribute to a better understanding of the online sales landscape and facilitate data-driven decision-making processes.

## Notebook 2: Amazon Reports Fetching

The second notebook focuses on fetching Amazon reports using the `python-amazon-sp-api` package. It includes the following steps:
1. Installation the sp-api package.
2. Configuration of Amazon Selling Partner API credentials.
3. Utilization of the sp-api package to fetch various reports such as sales, orders, inventory, and advertising reports.
4. Processing and analysis of the retrieved reports using `Pandas` and other relevant Python libraries.
5. Visualization of the analyzed data using Matplotlib or other visualization tools.

## Notebook 3: DPD Tracking Status Retrieval

The third notebook focuses on retrieving DPD tracking status.By retrieving the tracking process with `Selenium` and parsing the HTML response with `Beautiful Soup`, the project enables the retrieval of tracking updates for DPD packages or shipments.
